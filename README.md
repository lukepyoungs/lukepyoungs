### [Project 8: Smart Mirror](https://github.com/lukepyoungs/SmartMirrorProject)
- Capstone group project for ECE: our group created a Smart Mirror from scratch with a Raspberry Pi, fully creating all software and manually woodworking to craft the hardware. Personal contribution was on creating backend routes for applications, so they are updated appropriately with the right information.
   
## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Fun fact about me

Over the last 7 years, I have really enjoyed competing in golf. Throughout this time, I have developed a solid golf game, as well as many interpersonal skills. The golf
course was a place where I found refuge during the pandemic, and the sport has been great for my mental health through the practice of mindfulness. I always love discussing anything golf, feel free to reach out!
