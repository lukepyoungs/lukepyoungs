## ⛳️ Fun fact about me

Over the last 7 years, I have really enjoyed competing in golf. Throughout this time, I have developed a solid golf game, as well as many interpersonal skills. The golf
course was a place where I found refuge during the pandemic, and the sport has been great for my mental health through the practice of mindfulness. I always love discussing anything golf, feel free to reach out!
